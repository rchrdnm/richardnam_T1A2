## Description of the portfolio website

### Purpose

This portfolio is a place to present my projects and skills to potential employers and collaborators. The page page itself is the first project to showcase my knowledge of HTML, CSS and Git.

### Functionality / features

Rather than create a single page website, I wanted to experiment with linking different HTML documents to create a cohesive flow with my portfolio. As the web is made up of HTML documents, I wanted to build my project on the foundations of the web.

### Target Audience

First and foremost this project is intended for myself. My aim is to add to it incrementally as my skills develop and my projects expand. I hope by working on this portfolio I can showcase this to potential employers as I break into the industry as a web developer.

### Tech Stack

This website was built primary with HTML and CSS (using SCSS to make navigating the syntax of styling easier. ) All of the source code is stored on GitHub for version control.
